## What I Learned 🧠

Throughout the development of My Daily App, I gained valuable experience in:

1. **Next.js App Router**: Implementing file-based routing and leveraging server-side rendering capabilities.

2. **React Hooks**: Utilizing `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks for state management and side effects.

3. **TypeScript**: Enhancing code quality and developer experience with static typing.

4. **Tailwind CSS**: Creating responsive and customizable UI components efficiently.

5. **API Integration**: Working with various APIs including OpenWeatherMap, Alpha Vantage, and NewsAPI.

6. **Server-Side API Calls**: Implementing API routes in Next.js to securely handle API calls on the server.

7. **Dynamic Imports**: Optimizing performance by lazy-loading components.

8. **LocalStorage**: Managing user preferences and data persistence on the client-side.

9. **Framer Motion**: Adding smooth animations to enhance user experience.

10. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application looks great on various screen sizes.

11. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling for API calls and user interactions.

12. **Performance Optimization**: Techniques like code splitting and lazy loading to improve app performance.

## v0.dev Integration 🤖

During the development of this project, I experimented with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev), an AI-powered development tool. v0.dev assisted in:

- Generating initial component structures
- Providing code snippets for complex functionalities
- Offering styling suggestions using Tailwind CSS
- Troubleshooting and debugging issues

The integration of v0.dev significantly accelerated the development process and provided valuable insights into modern web development practices.
